# Introduction
This web app is to help you organize your tasks!

# Frontend
### Frontend Framework
This app was built using React on the front end.

### Frontend Functionality
With this web app, you can create todo items, add tags to those tags, and receive emails when the tasks are approaching (via Twilio SendGrid API)
Additionally, you can sort the todo items by completion status and due date.

# Backend
### Backend Framework
This app uses Express (built on Node.js) to create various endpoints to communicate with the Twilio SendGrid API.

# Improvements
Still need to work on hosting the app via Heroku and user error handling.
